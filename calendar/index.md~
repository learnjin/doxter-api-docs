## Introduction

Welcome to the doxter API specification for synchronisation. With the doxter API you can access your calendars, get updates of new bookings, reschedule bookings and block available times.  

### Authentication

HTTP Basic authentication. Username and password come from a valid login on doxter. One account can have many logins. One login can also be connected to many accounts. Passwords can be reset on the _login page_.  

API Base URL: https://www.doxter.de/api/v2/

Fields and Parameters

All times must be specified in iso8601 format.

4 RESTful verbs are supported:
GET: find objects
POST: create new objects
PUT: update objects
DELETE: remove objects

Calendars

Booked bookings are stored on the calendars. Calendars are created for the type of patients and problems a practice wants to be able to book. Furthermore calendars contain rules such as the window within patients are able to see available times. Since many practices discriminate between patients and services they offer, calendars contain an internal name to indicate what the calendar is used for.

Get all calendars from all accounts the user has access rights to.

Blockings

Blockings prevent times from being shown on doxter, e.g. vacations, or a specific date a practice doesn’t want to accept patients because of an equipment failure or other exceptional occurrences. Our API allows complete control over blockings from the user side. Be aware that if you create a blocking on a calendar, that calendar won’t show and allow bookings for that time frame.

GET /calendars/{id}/blockings/{?updated}

Get all updated blockings for the specified calendar.

Request params
updated: ISO8601 time. Only gives events which where updated since from and including that time.
