## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

The doxter Practice API is a service that returns information about doctor practices using HTTP requests. The service is accessed as an HTTP request and returns JSON only. The Pratice API uses a doxter ID to uniquely identify a practice.  

### <a name="authentication"></a>Authentication

The doxter Practice API uses BASIC AUTH to authenticate valid consumers. Contact Doxter to receive your credentials.  


## <a name="practice-search"></a>Practice Search

A Practice Search returns a list of practices along with summary information about each practice. The default is to return all active practices on doxter. The results may be paginated, in which case you find a `pageToken` in the metadata.  

A Search request is an HTTP URL of the following form:  

```
GET https://practices.doxterapis.com/v1/search?parameters
```

**Optional parameters**  

_(token explanation is taken verbatim from google calendar api)_  

- `sync_token` - Token obtained from the `next_sync_token` field returned on the last page of results from the previous request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set  

- `page_token` - Token obtained from the `next_page_token` field that is returned if the results are paginated. Optional, but always together with `sync_token`.  


## <a name="search-responses"></a>Search Responses

Search responses are returned JSON format. The following example shows a search result. The response has different fields depending on the type of practice.

The JSON response contains two root elements:  

`meta` - contains metadata on the request. See Status and Synchronization below.  
`results` - contains an array of practices with information about each. See Search Results for information about these results.  

### <a name="metadata"></a>Metadata

#### Status Codes

- `OK` indicates that no errors occurred  
- `INVALID_TOKEN` indicates that either the sync or page token is invalid.  

#### Synchronization

Using the metadata from the Practice Service "you can keep data for all [practice] collections in sync while saving bandwidth" ([_Synchronize Resources Efficiently, Google Calendar API_](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/sync)).  

- `next_sync_token` - Token used at a later point in time to retrieve only the entries that have changed since this result was returned. Omitted if further results are available, in which case next_page_token is provided.  

- `next_page_token` - Token used to access the next page of this result. Omitted if no further results are available, in which case next_sync_token is provided.  

## <a name="search-results"></a>Search Results

When the Practice service returns JSON results from a search, it places them within a results array. Even if the service returns no results it still returns an empty results array.

  - `title` contains the academic title like `"Dr."` or `"Prof. Dr."`  
  - `first_name` is the first name of the person  
  - `last_name` is the last name of the person  
  - `company` the name of the practice  
- `formatted_address` is a string containing the human-readable address of this place.  
- `international_phone_number` contains the place's phone number in international format.International format includes the country code, and is prefixed with the plus (+) sign. For example, the `international_phone_number` for Doxters's Berlin, Germany office is `"+49 30 609 849 65"`  
- `url` contains the URL of the official doxter page for this practice  
- `rating` the user's overall rating for this practice. Optional.  
- `rating_count` the number of ratings for this practice. Optional, but always given when `rating` is.
